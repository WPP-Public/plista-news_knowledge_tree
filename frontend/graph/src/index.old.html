        <h4>The sunset faded to twilight before anything further happened. The crowd far away on the left, towards Woking, seemed to
        grow, and I heard now a faint murmur from it. The little knot of people towards Chobham dispersed. There was scarcely an
        intimation of movement from the pit.</h4>

        <p>It was this, as much as anything, that gave people courage, and I suppose the new arrivals from Woking also
          helped to restore confidence. At any rate, as the dusk came on a slow, intermittent movement upon the sand pits
          began, a movement that seemed to gather force as the stillness of the evening about the cylinder remained
          unbroken. Vertical black figures in twos and threes would advance, stop, watch, and advance again, spreading out
          as they did so in a thin irregular crescent that promised to enclose the pit in its attenuated horns. I, too, on
          my side began to move towards the pit.</p>
  
        <p>Then I saw some cabmen and others had walked boldly into the sand pits, and heard the clatter of hoofs and the
          gride of wheels. I saw a lad trundling off the barrow of apples. And then, within thirty yards of the pit,
          advancing from the direction of Horsell, I noted a little black knot of men, the foremost of whom was waving a
          white flag.</p>
